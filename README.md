# Introduction
Cyber attacks against educational institutions, like universities and schools, have become a growing concern in recent years. In our increasingly digital world, these institutions hold a vast amount of valuable data, making them attractive targets for malicious actors. These attacks can have severe consequences, including data breaches, financial loss, disruption of operations, and compromised student and staff information.

Hackers and cybercriminals employ various techniques to carry out these attacks. They may use malware, such as viruses or ransomware, to gain unauthorized access to systems and networks. Phishing attacks, where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, are also common.

The impact of cyber attacks on educational institutions can be far-reaching. For example, a data breach can lead to the exposure of personal information, including student records, financial data, and research findings. This not only compromises the privacy and security of individuals but can also damage the reputation of the institution

To combat these threats, educational institutions must prioritize cybersecurity measures. This includes implementing robust firewalls, encryption protocols, and intrusion detection systems. Regular system updates and patching vulnerabilities are also crucial. Additionally, educating staff and students about cybersecurity best practices, such as strong password management and recognizing phishing attempts, can help prevent successful attacks.

# What is the problem? and how we can solve it ? 
A cyberattack exposes the personal data of about 95,000 pupils by targeting the Minnesota Department of Education.

Through hacking into data from the Minnesota State Department of Education, criminals have gained access to records on tens of thousands of youngsters, the bulk of whom are in the state's foster care system. Data from financial help applications submitted to the institution directly or via the standard Free Application for Federal Student help form were included in the stolen
Information.

The organization reported that on May 31, 24 files were compromised after they received notice of a potential weakness in Movie, their file transfer software
Comparable demographic data was also obtained for 29 students engaged in PSEO courses at Hennepin Technical College, five students who traveled a designated bus route run by the Minneapolis Public Transportation System, and 124 children who qualified for Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer.


# How the security breach/attack has successfully occurred?
 
 
A threat actor going by the alias "niggy"believed to have been responsible for the data breach at the University of Minnesota.
 
The hacker asserted that he gained access to the university's data warehouse, which houses documents that have been digitally archived since 1989, by using Computer Niggy Exploitation (CNE). Sensitive and priceless data regarding employees, instructors, and students was kept in this database system.
 
Providing Signals Intelligence to their connections on the Fediverse has been the attacker's main motivation. Affirmative action's impact was to be examined in light of a recent Supreme Court decision, utilizing admissions data from the University of Minnesota data breach.
 
Two CSV-formatted tables, "PS DIVERSITY"for diversity statistics and "PS_DWAD_APPL_DATA_HS" for admissions statistics, are included in the leaked material. One may use this data to determine the average ACT scores of admitted students according to their race, for example.
 
The community and university are concerned about the possible scope of the University of Minnesota data breach because the hacker's claim has not yet been independently verified. 


# Develop a contingency plan that could help the University of Minnesota avoid the associated risks.
 
 
The importance of risk management in project planning cannot be overstated, particularly for the University of Minnesota aiming to avoid associated risks. Project managers must prioritize risk identification, mitigation strategies, and contingency planning to prevent the chaos and failure that can arise from unmanaged risks. Successful risk management involves ongoing assessment and awareness, providing project managers with additional tools and techniques to 

navigate uncertainties. While various approaches and tools address risk estimation and project task network challenges, the assumption that risks can uniformly be addressed by extending timelines or allocating additional resources doesn't always hold true. Like a tightrope walker needing years of practice, project managers require detailed plans and processes to handle the inherent risks, distractions, and complexities of project management effectively. Unfortunately, some managers resort to reactive behaviors, such as adding unjustified contingencies, blaming others, or cutting corners in quality assurance, leading to repeated failures and undermining their credibility. To mitigate the impact of foreseeable risk-based failures, proactive steps should be taken, emphasizing the importance of learning from experiences and avoiding repetitive reactive patterns.
